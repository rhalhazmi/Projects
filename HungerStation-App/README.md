# HungerStation App Enhancement – Dietary / Healthy Food Section

Team project proposing and documenting an enhancement to the HungerStation food-delivery app by introducing a dedicated **Dietary / Healthy Food** section. The feature helps users quickly find meals suitable for specific diets (e.g., keto, gluten-free, allergy-friendly, diabetic-friendly), aiming to reduce navigation friction and improve the experience for health-conscious users.

## Key Features
- **Dietary / Healthy Food Category (New Feature):** highlights restaurants offering diet-friendly and healthy options.
- **Search & Filtering:** filters restaurants/meals by dietary preferences and needs.
- **User Accounts:** registration/login, favorites, and order history.
- **Order Management:** placing orders and receiving status updates.
- **Secure Payments:** supports multiple payment options (e-payments + cash on delivery).
- **Real-Time Tracking:** delivery tracking via mapping/location services.
- **Ratings & Reviews:** restaurant/meal rating and review support.
- **Recommendations (Concept):** personalized suggestions based on preferences and order history.

## Architecture (High Level)
Client–server design:
- Mobile client (iOS/Android) + UI layer
- API layer for request/response handling
- Server-side logic + database
- Supporting services for tracking, security, and recommendations

## Security & Reliability
- Protection of sensitive data (user and payment information) using encryption
- Strong authentication and optional two-factor authentication
- Testing coverage across core scenarios for reliability and usability

## Testing
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- System Testing (cross-platform)
