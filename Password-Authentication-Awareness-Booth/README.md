# Password & Authentication Awareness Booth — Cybersecurity Outreach

## Overview
An interactive cybersecurity awareness booth focused on password security and authentication methods. The booth explains why strong passwords and authentication matter for protecting accounts, preventing cyberattacks, and reducing financial loss. Topics include Single-Factor Authentication (SFA), Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), how to choose strong passwords, and phishing awareness.

## Why It Matters
Weak passwords and poor authentication practices increase the risk of account compromise. The booth raises awareness of:
- Strong password habits (length + complexity + avoiding personal info)
- Using multiple authentication factors (something known / owned / inherent)
- Recognizing and avoiding phishing attempts

## Content Covered
### Passwords & Authentication (Core Concepts)
- Password: a combination of letters/numbers/symbols to protect an account
- Authentication: identity verification before login/access
- Authentication factors:
  1) Something known (password / PIN)
  2) Something owned (phone / smart card / one-time code)
  3) Something inherent (fingerprint / face)

### Authentication Types
- SFA (Single-Factor Authentication): one factor only; simplest but weakest against leaks/guessing
- 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication): two different factors; much safer if password leaks
- MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication): three or more factors; highest security but more complex

### Strong Password Tips
- Use 12–16+ characters
- Mix letters + numbers + symbols
- Avoid names and personal information
- Use different passwords for different sites

### Phishing Awareness
- Avoid entering passwords through suspicious email links
- Verify website URL before logging in
- Avoid sharing personal data through untrusted messages

## Booth Activities & Materials
The booth included multiple interactive learning elements:
1. Presentation slides explaining the topic
2. Poster summarizing key points
3. Spin Wheel activity (questions + quick security advice)
4. CodeBreaker game to illustrate brute-force concepts
5. Password Puzzle game inspired by common password attack techniques
6. Giveaways with cybersecurity recommendations (stickers/chocolates)
7. Project stickers and awareness messages

### “Can You Crack the Code?” (Game Concept)
A color-based symbolic representation was used to teach password strength:
- Red = number
- Yellow = lowercase letter
- Green = uppercase letter
- Blue = special symbol
- Black = strong combination

## Team Roles (High Level)
Roles included:
- Preparing and presenting educational slides
- Designing the booth poster
- Running the Spin Wheel activity
- Running the CodeBreaker game and guiding participants
- Preparing the Password Puzzle activity and interacting with visitors
- Distributing giveaways and documenting the booth with photos
