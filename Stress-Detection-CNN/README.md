# Stress Detection Using Face Analysis (CNN)

Built a binary stress classifier from facial expressions by re-labeling FER-2013 into **Stress** (angry, disgust, fear) vs **No-Stress** (happy, neutral). Trained a CNN with data augmentation and evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Key Results
- Test Accuracy: ~79%
- F1-score: ~0.73
- ROC-AUC: ~0.88

## Tech Stack
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
